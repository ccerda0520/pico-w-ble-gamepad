# BLE Joystick Gamepad

## Description

This project uses the [arduino-pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) library, specifically the BLE joystick library, alongside a raspberry pi pico w, to assign physical buttons and a digital joystick to digital buttons in the gamepad format and output that to the connected device. 

## Dev Notes

- Requires at least "IPv4 + Bluetooth" stack to be enabled.
- Select the "Raspberry Pi Pico W" specific board from the selection of boards inside the library above.
